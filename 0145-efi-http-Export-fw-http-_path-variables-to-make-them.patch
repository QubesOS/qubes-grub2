Subject: [PATCH] efi/http: Export {fw,http}_path variables to make them global

The fw_path environment variable is used by http_configure() function to
determine the HTTP path that should be used as prefix when using relative
HTTP paths. And this is stored in the http_path environment variable.

Later, that variable is looked up by grub_efihttp_open() to generate the
complete path to be used in the HTTP request.

But these variables are not exported, which means that are not global and
so are only found in the initial context.

This can cause commands like configfile that create a new context to fail
because the fw_path and http_path variables will not be found.

Resolves: rhbz#1616395
